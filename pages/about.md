# About

Anju Neilju, a 2013 graduate of the Lake Washington Institute of Technology’s Environmental Horticulture program, a Certified Professional Horticulturist and a member of Washington State Nursery & Landscape Association is the owner of Bhumi Garden Designs.

Anju grew up on her father’s spice farm on the outskirts of Kerala, which is in the mountainous region of southern India. Along with cardamom, black pepper, coffee, cinnamon & cloves, were an abundance of bananas, jack fruit, guava, papaya & mangoes to be harvested from the rich soil. Taking this bucolic life on the farm for granted, it took her leaving it, to journey far away to America to bring her back to her origins with a broad artistic bend. 

Coming to America she heard the word & concept of “organic” for the first time. It intrigued her & made her want to feed herself and her family the cleanest & most nutritious diet possible. She would travel to organic U- pick farms to buy produce & happened to notice that there were abandoned fields filled with copious amounts of pig weed, a type of amaranth. When she inquired about it, the farmer was more than happy to have her gather, as much as she wanted, and take away with her. She went back again and again for more. This is what brought her back to the world of sustainable farming, which eventually lead her to study of horticulture.
