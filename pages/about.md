# About Us

__Bhumi Garden Designs, LLC__ is a landscaping and design company based out of Redmond. We specialize in container design, and 

I am a small space garden designer and specialize in container designs, bold container designs, lush and quick impact small space garden designs, and garden coaching with more than 5 years of experience as a Certified Professional Horticulturist (CPH).

Over the last five years, I have created beautiful container designs and quick impact small garden spaces, bringing so much joy to so many clients and building long lasting relationships! 
 
When I am not working in gardens, I spend time with my husband and two college going boys. My other passion is salvage fashion, decoration, and bargain shopping. Love to mix and match old and new styles and bring out the beauty in each! One thing I tell my boys and strive to live by: “Create your own unique style!"
