Having grown up on her father’s spice farm on the outskirts of Kerala - which is in the mountainous region of southern India – she was surrounded by an abundance of fresh fruits & vegetables grown right there on that farm, as well as a beautiful family flower garden. To some degree taking this bucolic life on the farm for granted, she left it and journeyed far away to America, eventually bringing her back to her origins with a broad, artistic bend.
