# About

I am a small space garden designer and specialize in container designs, bold container designs, lush and quick impact small space garden designs, and garden coaching with more than 5 years of experience as a Certified Professional Horticulturist (CPH).

**Containers:** For the high impact areas of a garden, nothing can beat the role of containers filled with seasonal color and evergreens for all four seasons!

**Small space garden designs:** I love designing small gardens while walking with the client. Honestly, I like to get things done fast, rather than going back and forth with a complicated paper design, which in most cases ends up hidden in a shelf!

**Garden coaching:** You can ask me garden questions & concerns, guidance on pruning, mulching, diseases, composting, and even watering! Ever wonder why a plant is still wilting after a continuous week of watering? Or, why your kales are packed with aphids? I’ll guide you every step of the way! 

Over the last five years, I have created beautiful container designs and quick impact small garden spaces, which bring so much joy to so many clients! The most fun part is building long lasting relationships!


When I am not working in gardens, I spend time with my husband and two college going boys. My other passion is salvage fashion, decoration, and bargain shopping. Love to mix and match old and new styles and bring out the beauty in each! One thing I tell my boys and strive to live by: “Create your own unique style!"
