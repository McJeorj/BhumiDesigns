"You have less that ninety seconds to make the first impression of the drive way entrance," explains one of my clients. Entry points of a garden should make a statement and Bhumi Garden Designs believes that sentiment deeply. This is where seasonal colors and containers come into action – influencing the way we think, act, and feel, containers make any landscape catch our attention and jump out from its surroundings. Seasonal colors in a garden are like an accent on a piece of jewelry, or the design and theme of a fashionable outfit – putting all the surrounding elements together and complementing the full product, it creates a statement. The resident, loved ones, and guests always feel special as they walk through the garden. The impact on the mind a soul that a beautifully designed and crafted garden possess is magical. Spending quality time enjoying the fragrance of the yard on a sunny summer afternoon, as the lavenders, gardenias, and daphnes compete for attention. It is the garden scape that can most effectively change a home’s effect on one’s lifestyle and wellbeing.
