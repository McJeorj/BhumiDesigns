"You have less that ninety seconds to make the first impression of the drive way entrance," explains one of my clients. Entry points of a garden should make a statement and Bhumi Garden Designs believes that sentiment deeply. This is where seasonal colors and containers come into action – influencing the way we think, act, and feel, containers make any landscape catch our attention and jump out from its surroundings. Seasonal colors in a garden are like accents on a piece of jewelry, or the design and theme of a fashionable outfit – putting all the surrounding elements together and complementing the full product, it creates a statement. The resident and the loved ones always feel special as they walk through the garden. The impact on the mind and soul that a well-designed garden with beautifully decorated containers and fragrant plants possesses is magical. Spending quality time on a stroll through the secret path filled with hydrangeas on both sides; the lavenders, gardenias, jasmines and the colorful containers compete for attention - whether it be a sunny summer afternoon or a pouring winter day when the shy scented sarcococca keeps flowers hidden and mesmerize visitors; it is the seasonal design that can most effectively change one’s lifestyle and wellbeing.
