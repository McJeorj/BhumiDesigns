Her landscape style is beautiful, and I loved her work ethic. When ever I came out to check in on the projects, Anju stops and always tells about the current progress, and what's going to stay and what's going to change. Anju is very flexible in scheduling, and I can always rely on her to arrive on time and deliver quality landscapes or plants needed for a concept garden.
